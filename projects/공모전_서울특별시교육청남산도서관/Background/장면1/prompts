black and white charcoal sketch, high contrast, stark, dark background, dynamic perspective, hand-drawn feel, gritty texture, Korean aesthetic. A close-up of a gleaming Olympic-style gold medal, its design strongly reminiscent of the Athens Olympics medals. It clearly depicts iconic Greek imagery such as a classical figure like the Goddess Nike and architectural elements resembling the Acropolis or Parthenon on its surface, rendered in a classic sculptural style. Crucially, the medal's surface is smooth and reflective with absolutely no discernible text, numbers, dates, or specific event names engraved. It hangs from a ribbon that might vaguely resemble subtle Korean traditional colors or patterns. The light is harsh and sharply catches the metallic surface, creating a sense of ultimate glory and isolated triumph.

파티
black and white charcoal sketch, high contrast, stark, dark background, dynamic perspective, hand-drawn feel, gritty texture, Korean aesthetic. A chaotic and crowded scene of a high-society party in a modern Korean setting. Silhouettes of people in contemporary fashion raising glasses, blurred figures dancing, and sparkling lights are hinted at in the dark. Focus on the fragmented, fleeting nature of the event, with bright glints against deep shadows, suggesting superficiality and a cold opulence.

빌딩
black and white charcoal sketch, high contrast, stark, dark background, dynamic perspective, hand-drawn feel, gritty texture, Korean aesthetic. A towering modern skyscraper in a bustling South Korean city like Seoul, with sharp, angular lines, reaching high into a dark, cloudy sky. The perspective is looking up, emphasizing its immense scale and dominance in an East Asian urban landscape. Minimalist composition, focusing on architectural grandeur and a sense of isolated power.

시계
black and white charcoal sketch, high contrast, stark, dark background, dynamic perspective, hand-drawn feel, gritty texture. A close-up of a luxurious, intricately designed wristwatch with a prominent dial, placed on a dark, smooth surface. Sharp lines and metallic reflections are rendered in stark black and white, creating a cold, precise, and aspirational feel.

돈
black and white charcoal sketch, high contrast, stark, dark background, dynamic perspective, hand-drawn feel, gritty texture, Korean aesthetic. A large, prominent stack of thick bundles of **South Korea's highest denomination banknotes**. The front of these banknotes *prominently* features the portrait of **Shin Saimdang**, clearly depicting her distinguished face. On the reverse side of some visible banknotes, the distinctive **ink bamboo painting (묵죽도 - Mukjukdo) by Shin Saimdang** is clearly rendered. These bundles are tied with bands, slightly disarrayed on a dark, reflective surface, suggesting immense wealth. The light is harsh, creating deep shadows and sharp highlights on the paper currency, emphasizing its cold, material presence as a symbol of the ultimate financial power. The overall impression should be unmistakably **the 50,000 Won note**, not 5,000 Won.
