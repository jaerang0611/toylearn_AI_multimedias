```
A Western man with long hair tied back in a ponytail plays a brown bass guitar, positioned in the middle left of the screen.
The man looks to the right, wears yellow-rimmed glasses, and sports a beard.
He is right-handed and wears a black short-sleeved T-shirt and pants.
The background appears blurred, evoking the feel of an African brown savanna. Faint mountain ridges are visible on the left and right, with a cloudless blue sky above.
